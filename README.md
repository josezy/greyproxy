# Greyproxy

A managed network proxy with a built-in web dashboard, rule engine, and REST API. Greyproxy wraps powerful multi-protocol tunneling capabilities with an intuitive management layer for controlling and monitoring network traffic.

This software is meant to be used with greywall (to be published soon)

## Features

- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time overview of proxy traffic, pending requests, and rule management, all served from a single binary
- **Rule Engine**: Define allow/deny rules with pattern matching on container, destination, and port
- **Pending Requests**: Review and approve/deny network requests awaiting a policy decision
- **Multi-Protocol Proxy**: HTTP, SOCKS5, and DNS proxies with forwarding chain support
- **DNS Caching**: Built-in DNS resolution and caching with hostname enrichment on requests
- **REST API**: Full HTTP API for automation and integration
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket-based live updates on the dashboard
- **Single Binary**: Web UI, fonts, icons, and assets are all embedded, no separate frontend to deploy

## Quick Start

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greyhavenhq/greyproxy.git
cd greyproxy/cmd/greyproxy
go build
```

### Configuration

Greyproxy uses a YAML configuration file. See [`greyproxy.yml`](greyproxy.yml) for a full example.

```yaml
greyproxy:
  addr: ":43080"        # Dashboard and API
  db: "./greyproxy.db"  # SQLite database

services:
  - name: http-proxy
    addr: ":43051"
    handler:
      type: http
    listener:
      type: tcp

  - name: socks5-proxy
    addr: ":43052"
    handler:
      type: socks5
    listener:
      type: tcp
```

### Run

```bash
./greyproxy -C greyproxy.yml
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:43080`.

## Default Ports
